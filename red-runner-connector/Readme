Environment:
-This project uses dependencies installed in the machine rather than having a lib folder with jar 

files. The reason for this
is so when the project is packaged with MAVEN, it can be done with all its dependencies bundled up with 

the jar file.

-If the nzjdbc (Netezza), ojdbc, sqljdbc artifactIds do not exist in your environment, you can install 

them with the following command:

-mvn install:install-file -Dfile=absolute/path/to/file.jar -DgroupId=com.groupid -

DartifactId=artifactName -Dversion=number -Dpackaging=jar

-Packaging with maven is not necessary, thus you can include the lib folder with jar files and add them 

to build path. Just remember to
delete dependencies from pom.xml.
